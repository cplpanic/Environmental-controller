# Environmental-controller

This is just a quick ReadMe to go with the project as you're fairly open to make this how you want and it's straightforward for a basic set-up.

To build this heater \ cooler You will need

-Thermoelectric Peltier      ~ £3  \ £8
-12\24 V Battery             ~ £5  \ £100
-Boost or buck converter     ~ 50p \ £2

Extra's

-PC heat sink and fan        ~ £3  \ £30
-Custom radiator             ~ £?
-Micro controller            ~ £2  \ £30
-Temperature sensor          ~ 50p \ £40
-Solar charge controller     ~ £8  \ £200
-Solar panel                 ~ £10 \ £1000
-Switch                      ~ 15p \ £3
-Display                     ~ £2  \ £25
-Timer \ clock               ~ £1  \ £4

This is just a best guess parts list and I'm honestly unsure on alot of the pricing (Supply issues) But the basics are still cheap and lead acid batteries at this time are easier to get a hold of.

So start with the basic layout and then add-on from that. With this it's important to get rid of the hot\cold side you don't want as they will start to neutralise each other. One side needs to be able to escape the room.

Sorry for the layout of this project a video was made to go with this project (Was too big to upload on GitHub - low quality) and just a formality a very professional wiring guide (Classic paint program ;p ) for the basic set-up & 3D model (FreeCad) for the window design - window was picked as it was stable and had easy access to the outside world, other area's doors, vents, walls.  

Hopefully this should be able to

-Change the room temp slowly over time or keep a room from turning freezing \ oven

-With 2 \ 3 units they can meet in the middle and complement each others zones

-Provide a cheap & simple heater \ cooler while we figure things out

-Experiment with gradual electronics that are low cost , slow build

-Jog others to come up with other methords 

Honestly guys have fun , stay warm... or cool :) This project might be something or nothing I just don't have the skill \ funds needed to test and build but with the current energy issues it might be worth someone looking into ?
